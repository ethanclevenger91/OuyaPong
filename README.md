	Game is playable. Options menu can be updated using "U" and "Y" buttons, return to main menu with "O" button. Left number represents background image selection. Right number represents music selection. Currently only two of each available. More to come, in addition to a meaningful UI for the options menu.

	Game plays with 2 players, fully functional options menu - multiple background songs and images. Need to work in second canvas in game screen so that background is not redrawn each frame.
